🚀 SIMPLE GPU FIX INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR ELECTRON APP
==================================================

PROBLEM: Your app uses 100% CPU and is slow because GPU isn't working for text generation.

SOLUTION: Follow these 4 easy steps:

📋 STEP 1: STOP CURRENT OLLAMA
   - Close your Electron app
   - Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
   - End any "ollama.exe" processes

📋 STEP 2: RUN GPU SETUP
   - Double-click: fix_amd_gpu.bat
   - Wait for it to finish
   - RESTART YOUR COMPUTER (important!)

📋 STEP 3: START OLLAMA WITH GPU
   - After restart, double-click: start_ollama_gpu.bat
   - Keep this window open (minimize it, don't close)
   - You should see debug information

📋 STEP 4: TEST THE FIX
   - Open a new terminal/PowerShell
   - Run: node test_gpu_after_fix.js
   - Check if speeds improved

🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:
   - Text generation: Under 2 seconds (vs 5-8 seconds before)
   - CPU usage: Much lower
   - GPU usage: Should show activity

⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING:
   If it's still slow after following all steps:

   1. Check if you have the latest AMD GPU drivers
   2. Your RX 570 might need different settings
   3. Some older AMD GPUs have limited AI acceleration

🔍 UNDERSTANDING THE FIX:
   - OLLAMA_GPU_LAYERS=999 → Use GPU for all model layers
   - OLLAMA_DEBUG=1 → Show what's happening
   - HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0 → RX 570 compatibility

📞 IF YOU NEED HELP:
   Run the test script and share the results. This will help identify
   what's working and what isn't.

🎉 WHEN IT WORKS:
   Your Electron app will be MUCH faster and use less CPU!
