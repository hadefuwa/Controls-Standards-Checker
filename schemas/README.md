## üîÑ **Version Control**

These schemas are stored in Git for:
- **Version tracking**: See how schemas evolve over time
- **Team collaboration**: Share consistent response formats
- **Rollback capability**: Return to previous schema versions if needed
- **Documentation**: Track changes and improvements

## üìö **Example Response Structure**

```json
{
  "thinking": "Let me analyze this safety question step by step...",
  "safety_assessment": {
    "compliance_status": "compliant",
    "risk_level": "low",
    "applicable_standards": [
      {
        "standard": "EN 60204-1",
