# Application Icons

This folder contains the application icons for different platforms.

## Required Icon Files:

- **icon.ico** - Windows icon (256x256 pixels recommended)
- **icon.icns** - macOS icon (512x512 pixels recommended) 
- **icon.png** - Linux icon (512x512 pixels recommended)

## How to Add Icons:

1. Create or find a 512x512 pixel PNG image for your app
2. Use online converters to create:
   - `.ico` file for Windows
   - `.icns` file for macOS
   - Keep the `.png` for Linux

## Temporary Solution:

If you don't have custom icons, electron-builder will use default icons during the build process.

## Suggested Icon Theme:
